The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there might be an uncommon bug related to incorrect operator precedence or order of operations.  For example, if you have `width: calc(100% - 20px);` and you expect the 20px to be subtracted from 100% of the container's width, it will work correctly. However, if you have a more complex expression like `width: calc( (100% - 20px) / 2 );`, there might be an issue if the parentheses are not properly placed or if you use different units improperly, leading to unexpected results or calculation errors.
