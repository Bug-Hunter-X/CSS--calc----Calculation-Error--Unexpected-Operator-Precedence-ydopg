To fix the potential precedence and unit issues within `calc()`, always use parentheses to group operations explicitly and ensure consistent units. For instance, in the complex calculation, the proper way to ensure subtraction is done before division would be: `width: calc( (100% - 20px) / 2 );`. This explicitly defines the order of operations. Always double-check the unit types involved in the calculation to avoid unexpected conversions or errors.
